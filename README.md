# IWAI2024-ambiguity

This is the companion repository to a paper presented at the International Workshop on Active Inference 2024 entitled:

"Planning to avoid ambiguous states through Gaussian approximations to nonlinear sensors in active inference agents."

The `demonstrations` folder contains notebooks with simple demonstrations of the model-predictive controller versus the free energy minimizing agents, as well as visualizations of the ambiguity landscape. The `experiments` folder details the Monte Carlo runs of the various free energy minimizing agents and the resulting visualizations.
